##  Description

This assessmentâ€™s goal is to measure the candidate's knowledge of Git, test case creation, test reporting, and the ability to adapt to automation tools.

The purpose of this assessment is to show your API and Web testing skills, knowledge in Git, test case creation, testing approach, and reporting, and the ability to adapt with automation tools.

We will evaluate the technical test depending on your seniority level by evaluating:

* the test strategy
* test coverage
* test cases
* practices adopted

## Prerequisites to develop the tests
- GitHub account

## Application Under Test

**BBlog** is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone).
It has an API that uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication and a Web interface that implements the API and enables the final users to use it through a web browser.

### General functionality

All the functionalities bellow are implemented in the API and Web layers:

- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

### API layer

The API endpoints and JSON return Objects are described in the [Api Specs](api-specs.md) document.

### Web Layer

The URLs, user to autenticate and basic functionalities descriptions are placed in the [Web Specs](web-specs.md) document.

## Deliverables

### Must-haves

These are the items you must deliver in your assignment. The technical part of assignment is slightly different and depends on which department you have applied to: RnD or CS.
If you are not sure which part of assignment is relevant for you, please ask your recruiter. 

**Candidates for both, RnD and CS need to deliver**
* Deliver the solution using either Java or Javascript/Typescript preferably 
* Create a **document containing a series of manual test cases** that cover **two functionality** that you choose
* Create an **Overall Evaluation Report** for the application containing:
   * the issues found
   * why you chose the test cases to automate
   * any other additional information you would like to add, e.g. risks, recommendations, approach, etc.
* Implement an **automatic test report** that must be generated after the tests run. (See requirements for automated tests below)
* Add clear **README** file containing:
  * how to run the test cases/suite (assume the reader does not know your coding language)
  * how to access the generated report
  
**Candidates for CS position:**
  * Create, at least, 5 (five) **automated scripts for Web tests** for different functionalities that can be run successfully.
  * Preferable programming language is Javascript/Typescript
 
**Candidates for RnD position:**
  * Create, at least, 2 (two) **automated scripts for API tests** for different functionalities that can be run successfully
  * Create, at least, 2 (two) **automated scripts for Web tests** for different functionalities that can be run successfully
  * Please select the functionality other than authentication/registration
  * Preferable programming language is Java or Javascript/Typescript
  

  
### Nice to have
* Suggestions for improvements
* Toggle for on/off headless execution for the front-end tests
* CI/CD scripts in any tool (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, etc..)
* Add more tests in addition to mandatory ones that will show us how do you approach test automation, which cases prefer to automate, why.
If any of additional tests should be failing because of existing bugs, please mention them explicitly in evaluation report. 
* Framework modules that can demonstrate your skills in the design and implementation of testing frameworks, e.g. layers, design patterns, or other architectural decisions. Please hold the balance of solution complexity vs tasks being solved, do not overengineer

### We will not accept
**This will automatically reject you**

* Use of record & play tools to generate both API and Web automated tests
* Deliver either API or Web part with no code or implemented with keyword-driven tools only. Ex: Postman collections, Karate specifications, Robot Framnework, etc...

### Additional information
* Candidates that do not deliver all the **Must haves** will be automatically rejected
* In case you apply for RnD position, you can either create only one project for the API and Web part or deliver parts of assignment in different repositories. In the latter case, you need to provide access to both repositories. 
* It is highly desirable to deliver the assignment implemented in the preferred programming language, however if you have big problems with it, you can use the language of your choice.

## How to deliver the assignment

### What do you need to deliver to us
As soon as you finish you must:

* Deliver the assignment in a private GitHub repository
  * **please, add ALL of the following users to your repositories:** 
     * General reviewers: `eliasnogueira` and `asterium`
     * Your tech recruiter (only one):
       * Danrley: `dbersagui`
       * Jakub: `JakJania`
* Don't forget to tell us where are the documents you created

### How long do I have to deliver the assignment?

* You can allocate as much time as needed, however focus on delivering your solution within 7 days from the moment of receiving the assignment. If more time is needed, please reach out to discuss the deadline

### How to run the Test
Run the command mvn clean test.

### How to view the Execution Report
